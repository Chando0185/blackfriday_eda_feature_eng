# Black Friday EDA and Feature Engineering with Streamlit Data Visualization Application

## Overview

This repository contains code and resources for conducting Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and Feature Engineering on a Black Friday dataset. Additionally, it includes a Streamlit Data Visualization app for interactive exploration of the analyzed data.

## Project Structure

The repository is organized as follows:

- `data/`: Contains the dataset used for analysis.
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebooks for EDA and Feature Engineering.
- `app/`: Streamlit app code for data visualization.
- `requirements.txt`: List of Python dependencies for easy setup.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Chando0185/blackfriday_eda_feature_eng.git
   cd blackfriday_eda_feature_eng

2.```bash pip install -r requirements.txt
3.streamlit run main.py

EDA and Feature Engineering
The notebooks/ directory contains Jupyter notebooks with detailed EDA and Feature Engineering steps. These notebooks cover various aspects of the Black Friday dataset, including data cleaning, visualization, and feature creation.

Streamlit Data Visualization App
The main.py code for a Streamlit app that allows users to visually explore the Black Friday dataset. The app provides interactive charts, graphs, and insights derived from the EDA.

To run the Streamlit app, use the following command from the project root:
